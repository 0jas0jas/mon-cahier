      <description>Known by so many different names, The RSA algorithm, the Asymmetric Encryption or the Public-Private key cryptography is easily one of the pillars that hold the largest network known to us together: the internet. It’s clever. It’s efficient. And it feels seemingly “loophole free”. We’ve all played with Caesar Cipher; Caesar Cipher might just be the simplest example of cryptography (probably the oldest) that we can play with. What’s up with this fancy new stuff then?</description>

      <description>Cryptography is not a new concept to humans. We have been encrypting messages, trying to make it impossible for other humans to read our messages. It is nothing new. In roman times, Julius Caesar came up with a new kind of encryption where he used to shift all the letters of the message to a certain number. This was called Caesar Cipher. We don’t know if this story is factually correct, but Caesar cipher might be the most known of all the simple encryption techniques.</description>
