I recently watched Dev Patel's Monkey Man. Loved it. This essay is kind of about that but also not really. It's just what I think about mixing and matching different things to make a new thing. An Uber for dogs. Headphones for potatoes. We've spent way too much time taking some well established thing and finding use for it in some other domain.

That's interesting.

I don't think anything in this world is original anyways. We're a mosaic of all the things we love. All the filmmakers we admire got inspired by other things. We're all a xerox of a xerox. What even is originality? What's creativity?

## Monkey Man

The indianness of this movie is so good. Watching it is such a delight. Even though it's being labelled as the John Wick of India, I couldn't see more different films. The camera is so active. Almost as its own character. It runs, rolls, jumps and does all the things an observing eye would do. While John Wick (I swear I counted this.) takes 37 takes in 30 seconds. I mean yeah John Green was made by stunt people and it's so amazing what they've achieved. John Wick makes the viewer feel like the punches.
