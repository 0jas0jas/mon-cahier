This is going to be a detailed post including everything in that we did in CodeDay Lucknow. Was it successful? Did we change things? How was the kebab like? All your questions will be answered in this page of *mon-cahier*. CodeDay Lucknow was a 24-hour event, first of its kind in Lucknow and a rollercoater of organisation. All the pictures are from CodeDay Lucknow, obviously. I don't know why I had to clarify that.

## The set up

It took roughly four months to plan CodeDay Lucknow. We started in a cozy cafe with the three of us friends. We had no idea about anything but we brainstormed a few ideas to start work on. Our first to-do was to get a team. 

Our team consisted of people from all around Lucknow. Nobody knew each other. We were from different schools with different strengths. I think we found our place in the team pretty quickly as the creative work started.

### The Creatives

One of the first things we designed was the CodeDay Lucknow logo. All [Pavani's](https://www.deviantart.com/enchantinghues) hardwork. (A lot of our creatives were Pavani's work. The entire team pitched in but the direction was usually Pavani-guided)

We posted our first instagram post with a good response from awadhi audience. We had an art direction, too, with our colour scheme being:

Violet - #67509F
Beige - #E1D0C1
Code-day pink - #FF686B
Teal - #52B5B5

We almost entirely used figma for all the instagram posts at the start. We jumped to Adobe Illustrator for some later posts and then canva for some recent ones.

I love figma because of his freedom. You can make anything you imagine. Yes, it takes a lot of time but it's worth it, at least for me. Canva on the other hand is simple and easy to use, but the output generally is too basic. Illustrator requires a very high level of skill so we let [Isha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isha-zaheer) handle illustrator.

### The workshops

Workshops at CodeDay Lucknow were a huge success, thanks to [Partho](https://github.com/daspartho) and [Vangmay](https://github.com/Vangmay). We sat down and decided what we wanted to do. We wanted to look at workshops from a different perspective. Quoting our registration form:

> "At CodeDay, we're reimagining workshops. Workshops are not classrooms, but rather places where like-minded individuals come and create something new! If you're interested in hosting a workshop, you don't have to have a whole workshop planned out; just come with an idea (something you're passionate about) and we'll help you design your own workshop."

Partho wrote emails to interested people and potential workshop hosts. One of his emails included our idea of a "GOOD workshop" which clearly explains what we were going for:

"OUR version of a good workshop:
- people go back with something new and different that they learnt
- it inspires them to go home and try more of it; not just for the session but also beyond it
- fun and creative
- it is not a class or a lecture where attendees are simply listening to you and seeing you do stuff, it should encourage them to actively engage in building alongside" - Partho

Some people actually thought the "Do you want to host a workshop?" toggle button was "Do you want to attend a workshop?" We crossed out about 50% of the people interested because they thought they had to click on "yes, I wanna host a workshop" to attend a workshop. 

I'm really thankful to Partho for working on this day and night, emailing so many people and telling them about our views on workshops. It's not an easy task when there are just so many kinds of people. 

Next step was to prepare the workshops. Vangmay and Partho brought in an AMAZING group of people for hosting a workshop. We'll talk about how workshops happened at CodeDay itself, but these people were not some experts with PhDs, they were very human, very normal teenagers. All they wanted was to share their knowledge with a group of enthusiastic people. I could see the excitement and the enthusiasm. We'll come back to the workshops later in this blog post. 

### The Outreach

"OJAS, WE DON'T HAVE ANY ATTENDEES. I AM VERY CONCERNED," said Mahi when she called me 10 AM in the morning (I wake up at 12. So does she.) Mahi and I make a great team. We've worked on so many things together and our ideas typically align perfectly. She's the kind of person who'll take everything under herself just for it all to be perfect. I respect that. 

In the last second week of May, I was diagnosed with hepatitis-A (not serious, very mild) and it messed up with my capacity to work. I took some long weeks off everything which caused us halt the outreach for CodeDay Lucknow. Mahi was in the US. We did have a few registrations by the first week of june, but we had missed something really important. Summer vacations start by the first week of june in our state so we could only go to one school, City Montessori School, Gomti Nagar 1. It's a big school, it got us about 30 registrations but it was enough at all. We couldn't physically go to schools (I couldn't physically go to schools). This was when Mahi called me all concerned. (shout out to [Akif](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0I5glCgpgTjz3bmINHyo7k?si=gZlC4vuzTMeesvDEPCNF-g) and [Prakhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakhar-verma-503bb2212/) for taking initiatives even when I was offline. They made sure we had consistent outreach through our social media)

We sat down as a team and came up with stuff to do. We ended up getting in contact (Akif and Prakhar again) a councellors' WhatsApp group which helped in outreach A LOT. We also got our brochures sent to WhatsApp group of the primary schools in Lucknow. (Isha and Manya helped contact La Martiniere)

By the end, we had 124 registrations and our event ran out of seats. So, outreach was, ultimately, a success.

### The food

Okay so I kept the easiest for the last. Food is SOOO easy to think about in Lucknow. Thank you, [Deven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadhavdeven/), for the domino's pizzas. We planned for our CodeDay to be very culturally appropiate, so we chose to have awadhi food for dinner which included biryani, kebabs and very awadhi breads. Breakfast was going to be sharma ji's samose and ban makhan, but due to some sharma ji reasons we couldn't do that. So, Deven, for the rescue again, got us Ram Asrey's Samose, Kachauris and Jalebi. All in all, you can't not love Lucknow's food, man. You just can't. Everything was bursting with flavour. I wrote our menu down in a crumbled piece of paper, which I might just keep as a souvenir.
