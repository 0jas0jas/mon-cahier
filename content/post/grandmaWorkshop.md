This text is actually a workshop? Yup. For the people who're currently IN my workshop, use this as a guide. I'll say everything that's written here almost literally. For the people who're just reading this for some reason? I don't know, live life I guess.

We've so many programming languages. Every programming language seems like their own mountain to climb. There's just so much to "parse" (so proud of that one). From monads to pointers to complicated single line statements. Learning programming languages sometimes feel like being stabbed multiple times by people who're better than you. That's not the case actually. I'm here to prove that. Hopefully, in the next 60 minutes (or however much time it takes to read this blogpost), you'll understand what I mean.

## Let's look at some languages

![Python Sample Program](../../pictures/GrandmaWorkshop/python.png)

Ah yes, Python. Famous for being super easy to understand. Even without all the things defined in this snippet, I'm pretty sure a lot of people would be able to tell exactly what this code is doing. How did our programming languages all trickle down to Python. The peak of simplicity. 

For the people wondering, this snippet loops through a bunch of tracks in a Spotify Playlist and prints/stores a bunch of information about the track including Genre, Name and other stuff. Don't worry if you didn't get exactly that, even realising that the code prints a bunch of information about something makes you experienced enough to read Python. 

![Java Sample Program](../../pictures/GrandmaWorkshop/java.png)

Java. A lot of people are taught Java in schools so I picked a snippet from one of my school homeworks. The code looks way more complicated than Python's. However, it's still very clear what the code is roughly doing. If you've seen some `System.out.println`, you should be able to understand a good chunk of what's happening here. 

The program asks you to enter three parts of your name. It then splits each part and prints it out. To do this, it finds the "index" of the space character " " in your input string. The fact that strings are just character arrays is being used here. This is a rather advanced concept but once you know that, it's quite clear that the index of the space character is used to print out seperated parts of the name. 

![Bhai Lang Sample Program](../../pictures/GrandmaWorkshop/bhailang.png)

Now we're entering unknown language territory. For our hindi speakers here, this might seem pretty funny. For the people who don't speak hindi, "bhai" is slang for brother in hindi. The language is a joke language based around the TypeScript host language. There's not a lot to unpack here once you know that `Bhai Lang` is just a TypeScript wrapper.

The program is just printing. That's all it does. It prints "Hello world", sprinkles in a decision statment and then wraps that around a loop. It's just a demo of some of the features in Bhai Lang. It's a joke programming language. Don't think too much about it. But I think it's interesting to notice that languages can be a bit weird.
